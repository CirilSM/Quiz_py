Certainly! Let's analyze the code to see if it covers various functional aspects:

1. **Menu System:**
   - The code provides a menu system for the user to choose a quiz topic.
   - The user can exit the program by choosing option 0.

2. **Quiz Topics and Questions:**
   - The code defines multiple quiz topics such as "Cyber Security," "Mathematics," "Simple Coding," "Riddles," and "Big Data."
   - Each topic contains a list of questions, options, and correct answers.

3. **Quiz Running Mechanism:**
   - The `run_quiz` function takes a topic as input, retrieves the relevant questions, and presents them to the user.
   - It allows the user to input their answers and provides feedback on correctness.
   - The scoring system is implemented to calculate and display the user's score.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - The code includes error handling for invalid inputs during quiz runs, ensuring the program continues smoothly.

5. **User Interaction:**
   - The user is prompted to input their answers, and the program provides feedback after each question.
   - At the end of each quiz, the user's overall score is displayed, and incorrect choices with correct answers are shown.

6. **Reusability:**
   - The code is structured with functions, making it modular and reusable. You can easily add more quiz topics or questions.

7. **Looping and Exit Mechanism:**
   - The code uses a `while` loop to allow the user to take multiple quizzes or exit the program.

8. **Data Structure:**
   - The data is organized in a dictionary (`quiz_data`), making it easy to manage and expand.

9. **Comments:**
   - The code includes comments, providing explanations for various sections and enhancing code readability.

10. **Scalability:**
    - The code is designed to handle additional quiz topics or questions without significant modification.

11. **Usability:**
    - The program provides a clear and user-friendly interface for taking quizzes.

It seems like you have covered a wide range of functional aspects, making the quiz program robust and user-friendly. If you have any specific concerns or areas you'd like to discuss further, feel free to let me know!
