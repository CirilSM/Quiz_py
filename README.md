||*Activity Diaghram* [link](https://github.com/CirilSM/Quiz_py/blob/main/Activity%20Diaghram%20(Updated).png)

This activity diagram illustrates the flow of activities in the quiz program. It starts with choosing a quiz topic and then proceeds through asking questions, checking answers, updating scores, and handling the end of the quiz. If the user chooses to exit the quiz, it displays a goodbye message; otherwise, it allows the user to choose another quiz topic.

||*Class Diaghram* [link](https://github.com/CirilSM/Quiz_py/blob/main/Class%20Diaghram(updated).png)

The class diagram illustrates the structure of a quiz system using classes such as QuizSystem, Quiz, Question, and User. These classes depict the organization of quizzes, questions, and users within the system, showcasing their attributes and relationships. Arrows between classes represent associations, providing a concise visual representation of the static structure and connections in the quiz application.

||*Use Case Diaghram* [link](https://github.com/CirilSM/Quiz_py/blob/main/Untitled%20Use%20Case.png)

The Use Case Diagram for the quiz application code involves a single actor, the "User," interacting with two primary use cases: "Choose a Quiz Topic" and "Run Quiz." The latter includes functionalities like displaying questions, receiving user answers, calculating scores, and providing feedback. Additionally, there's an extension use case, "Review Incorrect Choices," for displaying incorrect user choices.

The quiz class represents the quiz program and contains the main logic.
Question class represents a quiz question and its details.
User class represents a user with a name and their answers.
