>*Activity Diaghram* [link](https://github.com/CirilSM/Quiz_py/blob/main/Activity%20Diaghram%20(Updated).png)

This activity diagram illustrates the flow of activities in the quiz program. It starts with choosing a quiz topic and then proceeds through asking questions, checking answers, updating scores, and handling the end of the quiz. If the user chooses to exit the quiz, it displays a goodbye message; otherwise, it allows the user to choose another quiz topic.

>*Class Diaghram* [link](https://github.com/CirilSM/Quiz_py/blob/main/Class%20Diaghram(updated).png)

The class diagram illustrates the structure of a quiz system using classes such as QuizSystem, Quiz, Question, and User. These classes depict the organization of quizzes, questions, and users within the system, showcasing their attributes and relationships. Arrows between classes represent associations, providing a concise visual representation of the static structure and connections in the quiz application.

>*Use Case Diaghram* [link](https://github.com/CirilSM/Quiz_py/blob/main/Untitled%20Use%20Case.png)

The Use Case Diagram for the quiz application code involves a single actor, the "User," interacting with two primary use cases: "Choose a Quiz Topic" and "Run Quiz." The latter includes functionalities like displaying questions, receiving user answers, calculating scores, and providing feedback. Additionally, there's an extension use case, "Review Incorrect Choices," for displaying incorrect user choices.

The quiz class represents the quiz program and contains the main logic.
Question class represents a quiz question and its details.
User class represents a user with a name and their answers.



***REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING***

Requirements engineering is a systematic process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders in the development of a system. It involves activities such as elicitation, specification, validation, and management to ensure clear communication and successful project outcomes.

***ANALYSIS***

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on understanding and modeling the real-world problem domain within which a system operates. It emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to create a shared understanding of the business domain, resulting in a more effective and strategic design of software systems. DDD encourages the use of a ubiquitous language, strategic design patterns, and a focus on the core business logic to align software development with the complexities of the problem domain.

***CLEAN CODE DEVELOPMENT***


Clean code development refers to the practice of writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify. It emphasizes principles such as readability, simplicity, and clarity, aiming to produce code that is efficient and free of unnecessary complexity, making it more reliable and easier for developers to work with over time. Clean code is a concept popularized by Robert C. Martin and is associated with principles outlined in his book "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship."
